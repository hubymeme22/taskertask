# TaskerTask
My first day's hands-on project for React TS. This web app is designed to save task and track the local users via their username. This web app uses *local storage* for storing the said username and tracking of tasks for the specific user. The implementation of this with a working API backend will be added soon (probably tommorow) in a separate repository.

## Built using
- HTML
- CSS
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React TS](https://react.dev/)

## Setup and Installation
Run the following commands to download and setup the web app:
```
git clone https://github.com/hubymeme22/taskertask.git
cd taskertask
npm install
npm run dev
```
